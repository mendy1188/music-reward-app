# Starter Files

This directory contains template files to get you started. The lint errors you see are expected - they'll resolve once you set up a proper React Native/Expo project.

## 📁 What's Included:

- **`types/index.ts`** - TypeScript interfaces
- **`constants/theme.ts`** - Design tokens and sample data  
- **`stores/`** - Zustand store templates
- **`components/ui/GlassCard.tsx`** - Glass design system
- **`app/(tabs)/index.tsx`** - Home screen example

## 🚀 Next Steps:

1. **Copy these files** to your actual Expo project
2. **Install dependencies** as shown in main README
3. **Adapt the code** to your implementation needs

The structure follows Belong's architecture patterns from their mobile app.
